				<h2>Artist Statement</h2><br/>
				<p>
					When I begin a painting, I rarely know the direction it will take. My technique is deliberate, but the images themselves evolve in a &#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221; fashion. It’s a process of trust, both scary and exhilarating, that draws on a highly personal store of experiences, thoughts and concerns.  The culminating work of art, with traces of earlier stages still visible, reveals a decision-making process guided by the hand and heart of a human being.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abstracted imagery works on a different level than representational imagery. By its nature it’s suggestive, not descriptive. This openness means a viewer must work his way into a painting, creating his own context as he does. This consciously active viewing is one of the joys of working abstractly because it feels like a collaboration with the viewer. His response to the art is its finishing touch.
				</p>

					These watercolors, acrylics and mixed media are combinations of spontaneity and control. They begin with drifts of color on wet paper or on panel, often with an arbitrarily applied resist underneath. As they dry, textural effects are achieved through a variety of applied techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second phase involves developing the images suggested by the dried pigment. Guided by a free association of ideas, I build a composition by accentuating existing shapes and adding new ones, glazing layers of color, painting in new texture, line and shapes, or subtracting out shapes with water using a sponge over templates of cutout acetate.
				</p>
				<p>
					From this point forward the work develops its own rhythm, moving between adding and subtracting, often ending with a piece that has only a faint resemblance to the original washes. Other media may be introduced along the way such as collaged papers, gouache, acrylic and colored pencil. Glimpses of earlier stages are deliberately left in the final work.

				<h2>About Teaching</h2><br/>

				<p>
					Sharing in the excitement of discovery, regardless of the age of the student, is one of the best parts of teaching. Art communicates. When a student begins to realize the power of her visual voice, her ability to communicate expands exponentially. For an artist teacher, facilitating that growth is as creative as working in the studio.
				</p>
				<p>
					I work with all ages and never tire of it.
